# Nextflow-RNAseq

A bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for RNA sequencing data, written in the new nextflow DSL2 language syntax, leveraging nextflow modules.
Tested with Nextlfow version 19.09.o-edge (https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow)

# Credits
- The original pipeline was forked from the amazing nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, originally developed at the National Genomics Infrastructure at SciLifeLab in Stockholm, Sweden by Phil Ewels (@ewels) and Rickard Hammar√©n (@Hammarn).
- this DSL2 rewrite based on the cellgeni/rnaseq fork (from the Cellular Genetics program at the Wellcome Sanger Institute).
